First things first, this HUD is a heavily modified broeselHUD. All of the original settings (I think) are
uncommented next to the new values.Thanks to the author for the already-minimal style for me to make this
godforsaken barren wasteland of a display.

Secondly, you will hate this HUD. Probably.

Anyway.

To install this, copy the LackHUD folder into your tf/custom/yourfoldernamehere directory, same as every HUD.
Then copy the tf_english.txt into the tf/resource directory and make a backup of the old one. Don't worry,
nothing bad happens if you alter this, no VAC, SMAC, or Steam bans. It's the language file for client HUD fields.

==:ATTENTION:==:DISCLAIMER:==
This HUD lacks many of the "standard" HUD elements that you'll find in others. These are things I personally find
distracting, unnecessary or redundant (hence the name LackHUD). YOU WILL PROBABLY HATE THIS, COMP AND PUBSTAR ALIKE.
And that's fine, I guess, but many gameplay elements in TF2 have multiple indicators. Item effect meter timers have
the ding sound upon full refill, Medic spam keeps a constant indication of everyone's health, Spy's watches have
meters built into them, and while they're not entirely accurate, you truly learn the timing of the Spy meta.

LackHUD is more of a "You Should Already Know What Everything Does, When, And How" HUD than an info-crammed competitive
display. I'm an aural person, I do best when listening to the game rather than catching flashes of names and numbers to
pull your attention from that incoming airburst sticky or bombing Soldier.

So if you're interested in a different, more "immersive" and minimal HUD (meaning you have like 2000+ hours and gamesene)
give this a try. Here's what you'll be missing.

1.) Target ID is limited to displaying only a Medic's Ubercharge (visible looking at a Medic on your team or enemy as Spy).
No ally or enemy name, health, or ammo count. No shaded bars, meters, weapon names. Just your team and the enemy Medic's uber.
Because knowing your heal order, having situational awareness, "Medic!" spam and communication (hopefully, amirite?) let you
know who needs healing and how much. LEARN.

2.) No ItemEffectMeters. This means cloak, Hunstman charge, Demo charge (both shield and sticky), Spy-cicle, all of it no
longer exists on your screen. "DING!" Targe is good to go. "DING!" Dead Ringer's back. And don't worry, Medic's Ubercharge
is like the health and ammo; BIG. FUCKING. NUMBERS. They turn green at 100% Uber.

3.) Objective/Payload/CP/KotH/CTF/Timers are all gone. The Administrator makes everything that's going on with that stuff
loud and clear.

4.) No Damage/Heal Numbers. tf_dingaling_pitchmaxdmg 5 and tf_dingaling_pitchmindmg 195 tell you all you need to know about
damage, and again, this expects that you've learned all of Medic's meta, eliminating some clutter from the screen. Because that
Sniper just scoped you while you were looking at Demo's flashing red 69 health on your neat black shaded bars that cover a
third of your screen.

5.) Freezecam stuff. Like when you die, what the other guy is holding, all that.

6.) Killfeed teamcolor no longer exists, it's black and white. Because I wanted it to be. It matches the style and looks
good, okay? Everyone else has a black background, your kills/assists/deaths show up with a white background. Simple.

7.) Tiny, itty bitty outlined dot crosshair centered perfectly on my 1280x720 resolution. Should be fine on your res too....(?)

I dunno, there's probably more, but I'm bored of writing this readme. Go install the damn thing, or let me know what part
of Hell I should go fuck myself in for releasing this abomination.
